# Snake Vue Max

A retro snake game with a Nixie-tube-like timer/scoreboard, written in TypeScript + Vue 3 + Vite, made for learning purposes.

I write the snake class using two ways: arrays(snake.ts) and LinkedList(snake_linked.ts & linkedList.ts).

# Design

Most of the graphics are designed by myself (sorry for my bad design), except the PCB pic at the bottom. You can view the PSD file in the Release.

The font of the nixie tube is [Oslo II](https://www.1001fonts.com/oslo-ii-font.html)
