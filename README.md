# max-vue-snake

A retro snake game on TypeScript + Vue 3 + Vite comes with a nixie-tube-like timer/scoreboard for my study.

I write the snake class using two ways: arrays(snake.ts) and LinkedList(snake_linked.ts & linkedList.ts).

# Install & Usage

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm build
```

# Design

Most of the graphics are designed by myself (sorry for my bad design), except the PCB pic at the bottom. You can view the PSD file in the Release.

The font of the nixie tube is [Oslo II](https://www.1001fonts.com/oslo-ii-font.html)
